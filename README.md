# GlacierMIP3

[GlacierMIP](https://www.climate-cryosphere.org/mips/glaciermip/about-glaciermip) is a framework for a coordinated intercomparison of global-scale glacier mass change models to foster model improvements and reduce uncertainties in global glacier projections. It is running as a 'Targeted Activity' under the auspices of the Climate and Cryosphere Project [CliC](https://www.climate-cryosphere.org/), a core project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP).

GlacierMIP3 and its experimental design and protocol were developed in 2020/2021 by Harry Zekollari (chair), Fabien Maussion, Lilian Schuster, Regine Hock and Ben Marzeion. 

This repository holds the description of the experimental protocol and other documents relevant for the third phase of GlacierMIP launched in 2021: **GlacierMIP3: Equilibration of glaciers under different climate states (GlacierMIP3 - Equi)** together with the code for the analysis of the resulting community estimate paper. 

All instructions of how to perform the experiments can be found in the [GlacierMIP3 protocol](GlacierMIP3_protocol.md). Everything that was necessary for the GMIP3 submission is in the folder [0_experimental_protocol_files](0_experimental_protocol_files), where the  submission file names and format conventions are described in [netcdf file format notebook](0_experimental_protocol_files/netcdf_templates/netcdf_file_format.ipynb) with some sample files available in the [netcdf_templates](0_experimental_protocol_files/netcdf_templates) folder. A list of [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](GlacierMIP3_FAQ.md) is available. If you have other questions, or if you'd like to make suggestions about the project, use 
[github issues](https://github.com/GlacierMIP/GlacierMIP3/issues).

This community estimate manuscript resulted out of GlacierMIP3:

Code for the community estimate paper below is in the following folders with respective READMEs:
- [0_pre_post_processing](0_pre_post_processing) documented in [README_0_pre_post_processing.md](README_0_pre_post_processing.md)
- [A_community_estimate_paper_analysis](A_community_estimate_paper_analysis) documented in [README_A_community_estimate_paper_analysis.md](README_A_community_estimate_paper_analysis.md)


The regional GlacierMIP3 glacier projections for the different glacier models and experiments are available and documented via [LINK will be added soon](LINK-ZENODO). In addition, postprocessed data for the community estimate manuscript are included there. The data documentation is also available in [README_data.md](README_data.md).


When using this dataset, please cite both the Zenodo dataset and the submitted study above. Note that we are working currently on another study to analyse more the glacier model differences.
