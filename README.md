# GlacierMIP3

[GlacierMIP](https://www.climate-cryosphere.org/mips/glaciermip/about-glaciermip) is a framework for a coordinated intercomparison of global-scale glacier mass change models to foster model improvements and reduce uncertainties in global glacier projections. It is running under the auspices of [CliC](https://www.climate-cryosphere.org/), a core project of the World Climate Research Programme.

This repository holds data, computer code and documents used for the third coordinated experiment: **GlacierMIP3: Equilibration of glaciers under different climate states (GlacierMIP3 - Equi)**.

All instructions of how to perform the experiments can be found in the [GlacierMIP3 protocol](https://github.com/GlacierMIP/GlacierMIP3/blob/main/GlacierMIP3 protocol.md). The output file name and formate convention is described in the [netcdf_file_format notebook.](https://github.com/GlacierMIP/GlacierMIP3/blob/main/netcdf_file_format.ipynb). 

Use the [issues](https://github.com/GlacierMIP/GlacierMIP3/issues) if you'd like to make suggestions about the project.
