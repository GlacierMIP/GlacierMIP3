# GlacierMIP3

[GlacierMIP](https://www.climate-cryosphere.org/mips/glaciermip/about-glaciermip) is a framework for a coordinated intercomparison of global-scale glacier mass change models to foster model improvements and reduce uncertainties in global glacier projections. It is running as a 'Targeted Activity' under the auspices of the Climate and Cryosphere Project [CliC](https://www.climate-cryosphere.org/), a core project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP).

This repository holds data, computer code, the description of the experimental protocol and other documents relevant for the third phase of GlacierMIP launched in 2021: **GlacierMIP3: Equilibration of glaciers under different climate states (GlacierMIP3 - Equi)**. GlacierMIP3 and its experimental design and protocol were developed in 2020/2021 by Harry Zekollari (chair), Fabien Maussion, Lilian Schuster, Regine Hock and Ben Marzeion. 

All instructions of how to perform the experiments can be found in the [GlacierMIP3 protocol](GlacierMIP3_protocol.md). The submission file names and format conventions are described in the [netcdf file format notebook](netcdf_templates/netcdf_file_format.ipynb) with some sample files available in the [netcdf_templates](netcdf_templates) folder. 

Use [github issues](https://github.com/GlacierMIP/GlacierMIP3/issues) if you'd like to make suggestions about the project.
