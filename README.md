# GlacierMIP3

[GlacierMIP](https://www.climate-cryosphere.org/mips/glaciermip/about-glaciermip) is a framework for a coordinated intercomparison of global-scale glacier mass change models to foster model improvements and reduce uncertainties in global glacier projections. It is running under the auspices of [CliC](https://www.climate-cryosphere.org/), a core project of the World Climate Research Programme.

This repository holds data, computer code and documents used for the third coordinated experiment: **GlacierMIP3: Equilibration of glaciers under different climate states (GlacierMIP3 - Equi)**.

Use the [issues](https://github.com/GlacierMIP/GlacierMIP3/issues) if you'd like to make suggestions about the project.

Watch this space for more content soon!

So far there are just some postprocessing steps of ISIMIP3b data inside.
