# GlacierMIP3: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Why are the repeat years (‘shuffling key’) imposed? Will the impact on the results not be limited as long as the year selection is randomized?

It is indeed true that the effect of shuffling the years in a different order is likely to be very small to almost nonexistent. However, while preparing the experimental protocol for GlacierMIP3, we found out that it was not straightforward to determine whether every year should be 'picked' at least once every 20 years (length of reference time period for every experiment), or whether this could be totally random (i.e. possibility to have a single year occuring more than once in 20-year time sequence). We decided to go for the former option (i.e. a single year cannot be 'picked' more than once every 20 years), and to avoid any possible confusion, we opted to impose this 'shuffling key' (thereby also limiting the effect of the 'order of the picking', even if very small).

## Why are reference datasets (e.g. for ice thickness and for past climatology) not imposed? Will this not complicate the comparison of results?

Imposing the datasets to be used does indeed allow for a more straightforward comparison of the model output. However, ‘forcing’ the participants to use a given datasets would likely be a limiting factor for some groups to participate, as this would result in (a lot of) additional work (e.g. to recalibrate the model to new ice thickness or climate dataset). The present 'open' formulation, where we leave this up to the participant to decide, will indeed have the disadvantage that a direct comparison between the models is less straightforward. However, the 'open' approach has the advantage that groups can use their (calibrated) models 'as is' (e.g. as used in GlacierMIP2), which will likely save a lot of time and efforts for the participants (e.g. for the past climate forcing, some groups typically use CRU, others ERA5,..etc).
