# Community estimate paper analysis and figure creation - Notebook overview:
Most recent postprocessing date: `DATE = "Feb12_2024"`

Pre and postprocessing is described in [README_0_pre_post_processing](README_0_pre_post_processing).

Note that you need the package versions as in mamba_packages_oggm_gmip3_sept20_2024.yml. Or you have to manually install pandas v2.1.3, xarray v2023.11.0, numpy v1.24.4. For some postprocessing, you also need to install oggm oggm (e.g. v1.6.2) /progressbar2. That means you could do the following steps:
> mamba create --name <gmip3_env> --file <mamba_packages_oggm_gmip3_sept20_2024.yml> 
> mamba activate gmip3_env
> pip install --user --no-deps oggm progressbar2
  
To run the code, you need to download the GlacierMIP3 data from Zenodo. For some notebooks, you need additional data, which you can download from the OGGM cluster's GlacierMIP3 folder (https://cluster.klima.uni-bremen.de/~lschuster/GlacierMIP3/) by going to the respective path. In case of questions, please ask [Lilian Schuster](mailto:lilian.schuster@uibk.ac.at).

### 1: Visualise the 80 steady-state constant climate experiments
`1_gmt_climate_scenarios_figure.ipynb`
- creates **supplementary figure XX** that shows the climate timeseries
  - `fig_ED_XX_climate.png`
- to run the code, you need additional climate data from ISIMIP3b that are available here: https://cluster.klima.uni-bremen.de/~lschuster/isimip3b/isimip3b_tasAdjust_monthly 


### 2: Compare dta relative to temp. change data 

`2a_glacier_vs_climate_change_evolution.ipynb` 
- Shows summary glacier evolution time series and steady-state mass estimates dependent on the applied climate experiment
- creates **Figure 1, 2 and several supplementary figures XX (variants of Fig. 2)**
    - global plot, and for every RGI region, showing results by always using median (and quantiles) of glacier models 
    - creates figures of global vs regional warming (for supplements)

`2b_find_equilibrium_steady_state_yr.ipynb`
- Computes year where region reaches steady-state
- creates **supplementary figure XX**

    
### 3: Further analysis of steady state, time to reach 50 or 80% of the total changes, and of regional characteristics related to these regional differences

`3a_response_time_analysis_with_2020_shift.ipynb`
- Visualises example timeseries and response timescales for different glacier models and climate experiments 
    - creates timeseries for each region/glacier model and all experiments with global warming >=1.2Â°C. Example time series in **supplementary figure XX**, remaining variants are in `figures/supplements/only_github_supplements/figS5_variants`
    - creates **supplementary figure XX,XX** of "Time to reach 50%/80 % of the changes statistics" 

`3b_create_fig4_plus_regional_correlations.ipynb`
- creates **Figure 4, Supplementary figure XX,XX** on regional correlation coefficients and different reponse timescale definitions

### 4: further aggregated figures: world map
`4_world_map_figure.ipynb`
- creates **Figure 3 world map**, figure variants are in `figures/supplements/only_github_supplements/fig3_worldmap_variants`

### 5: Discussion analysis with just supplementary/extended data figures
`5_comparison_to_marzeion_et_al_2018.ipynb`
- creates **supplemenentary figure XX , formerly extended data fig. 3**
- comparison of the GlacierMIP3 results (relative to inventory date) to those from Marzeion et al., (2018)
- compares also the temperature sensitivities between Marzeion et al. 2018 and GMIP3 (number possibly mentioned in main text)

`5_comparison_to_zekollari_et_al_2024_rounce_et_al_2023.ipynb`
- comparison to the 2100 projections of other studies
- computed the glacier mass loss sensitivity to temperature changes by using the 2100 projection of rounce et al. 2023 (estimate mentioned in main manuscript)
- creates **supplementary figure XX, formerly Extended data Fig. 4**: comparison plot of regional glacier mass loss from transient glacier projections until the year 2100 (Zekollari et al., 2024) versus the GlacierMIP3 steady state glacier mass losses

`5_conversion_to_SLR_equivalent.ipynb`
- creates a fit of how much glacier volume below sea-level is lost vs total volume (by using OGGM data). This fit is used later in `6_csv_tables_creation.ipynb` (this needs a lot of additional raw files from OGGM simulations, and only runs on the OGGM cluster in Bremen).
- also creates **supplementary figure XX** to show the relationship of the ratio to the total volume (and the applied fit from the OGGM data)

`5_suppl_per_glacier_model_fit.ipynb`
- creates **supplementary figure XX**  with per glacier model LOWESS fits
- uses the per-glacier model LOWESS fit (more in `README_data.md`)

`5x_RGI04_barnes_ice_cap_analysis.ipynb`
- analysis of some per-glacier files just for the Barnes Ice cap RGI IDs
- this needs per-glacier model files (ask us to get these files)


### 6: Create supplementary data tables
`6_csv_tables_creation.ipynb`
- creates **supplementary data table 3** about current and past volume changes (+ some regional characteristics from RGI6, such as regional glacier surface slope)
- creates **supplementary data table 3** with steady-state regional glacier mass and response timescale estimates with uncertainties ...
- tables are saved as .xlsx files for the manuscript and then some minor formatting adjustments were manually done
